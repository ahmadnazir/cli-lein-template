# cli

A Leiningen template for clojure applications that can be executed natively from the cli.

## Usage

[Optional] If you want to install from source:

```
lein install
```

Create a new app:

```
lein new cli app
```

### Build Native Executable

The bare bones app created for you prints hello world. Once built, a binary is
created on the project root directory. It runs in ~5 ms as compared to ~850 ms
when using the JVM.


```
cd app
bash build.sh                                      # Create a native executable
time ./app                                         # Run it!
                                                   # and get blazing fast run times :)
```

Output:

```
Hello world!
./app  0.00s user 0.00s system 76% cpu 0.004 total
```
